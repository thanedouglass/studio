# 🧠 The Nexus Research Collective

## 📖 About the Project

The **Nexus Research Collective** is a digital matchmaking and public pledge platform designed to connect underrepresented students and early-stage researchers with labs, mentors, and active research opportunities. Built on Firebase and styled with Framer Motion and MUI, this prototype acts as a gateway into a more equitable and accessible scientific future.

> "Double what you are. Giveback what you know. Shift what they said was fixed."  
> — _DGB Manifesto_

This project is an extension of the **Double & Giveback Inc.** mission to shift limiting realities through creative mediums, including research, art, and tech.
