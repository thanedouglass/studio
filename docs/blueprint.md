## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Deep, rich dark background (#121212) for a classy, minimalist feel. This provides a strong base for content to pop.
- Primary: A vibrant purple (#A78BFA) is used for key interactive elements such as the 'Search' button and active filter states, embodying the idea of discovery and knowledge-seeking without feeling too clich√©. The brightness helps focus the eye.
- Accent: A complementary light blue (#7DD3FC) is used to highlight secondary actions and information, creating a balanced contrast against the primary purple. This is mainly for highlighting individual projects within the platform.
- Use clean, modern, sans-serif fonts for headers and body text to ensure readability. A slightly larger font size for the project titles can draw the users' attention.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons for filter options and other UI elements. These should be in the accent color (#7DD3FC) to ensure they are noticed but don't detract from readability.
- Employ a card-based layout for research opportunity listings. Ensure that each card has clear sections for title, PI info, research subject, and a 'View Details' button.
